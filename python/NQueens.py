# One of the Famous Backtracking algorithm N-Queens Alogorithm
#The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
# The Queens Should not be of same row
# The Queens Should not be of same col
# The Queens Should not be be of same Diagonal

# Algorithm to solve
# Only increment the row from here So that you dont have to check for rows condition
# For Columns and Diagonals Create a set where if you have seen a element save it
# There Are two types of diagonals we are dealing here : # Positive Diagonal( Top to Bottom) and Negative Diagonal (Bottom to Top)
# Here for every positive Diagonal in the square (rows + columns) remains Constant at any instance
# Same for every Negative diagonal in the square (rows- columns) remains Constant at any instance
# Saving instance in set or Hashset and checking instance helps us in finding the solution through backtracking
